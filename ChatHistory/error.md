This error message suggests that there is an issue with the proxy server that you are using to connect to the OpenAI API. The proxy server is unable to establish a connection with the OpenAI server, resulting in the "Max retries exceeded" error.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check your internet connection: Ensure that you have a stable internet connection and can access other websites without any issues.

2. Disable the proxy server: If you are using a proxy server, try disabling it and connecting directly to the internet. This will help determine if the proxy server is causing the problem.

3. Verify proxy server settings: If you need to use a proxy server, double-check the proxy server settings to ensure they are correct. Make sure the proxy server address, port, and authentication details (if required) are accurate.

4. Contact your network administrator: If you are connecting through a corporate network or using a proxy server provided by your organization, reach out to your network administrator for assistance. They may be able to troubleshoot the issue or provide an alternative solution.

5. Try a different network: If possible, try connecting to the OpenAI API from a different network to see if the issue persists. This can help identify if the problem is specific to your current network or proxy server.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, you may need to contact the OpenAI support team for further assistance.
